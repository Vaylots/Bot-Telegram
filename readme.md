# Telegram Bot with using Aiogram and SQL

---

### 1. I used Python with Aiogram and MySqlConnector libraries.

### 2. The bot notifies which anime is out today, for this it parses data from the site with anime and sends it to subscribers.

##### Parsing code from the site:

###### Similar days of the week are parsed according to the same principle, only you need to change the day of the week.

## 3. To get a list of subscribers, the bot accesses the SQL database.
